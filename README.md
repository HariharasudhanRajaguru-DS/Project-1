### Sample Project 1: Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

We predicted the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars.

Other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### Questions:

1. What are the factors playing major role to safely launch the first stage successfully?

2. Finding relationships with each variable for a successful landing?

3. What are the variable measures has to taken for a successful landing?

### Data collection
